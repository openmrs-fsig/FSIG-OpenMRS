# Launch EC2 instance

These steps go over creating a brand new EC2 instance from the AWS dashboard. In most cases you should be able to use the existing production and sandbox environments, but these steps are useful if upgrading to a new version of OpenMRS or Amazon Linux. 

1. Log into AWS dashboard and navigate to EC2 management page. In the top left corner, click the button that says Launch Instance
2. Enter a name for your instance. You are able to edit this name after deployment if needed. 
3. Select the image to base your EC2 instance off of. If starting from scratch, select the Amazon Linux AMI of your choice. You can also click My AMIs in this section and select from a handful of our own AMIs that are essentially server snapshots taken at various levels of configuration.
4. Select your instance type. If create a production environment, make sure your instance type is t2.medium or larger. If creating a sandbox environment, your instance type can be t2.small. 
5. Select the OpenMRS instance key from the Key pair dropdown menu. This is necessary to ensure we can SSH to the new instance using our .pem key. 
6. Under Network settings, click Select existing security group and then select the OpenMRS security group
7. Under configure storage section, make sure it is a 1x40 GiB gp2 root volume
8. On the righthand side of the page, click Launch instance

In a few minutes your instance should be provisioned and ready to access.
