# TLS Configuration

TLS(transport layer security) is the protocol that encrypts our application data and secures our site. With TLS properly set up, you will see a little lock icon in the browser window that indicates the site is secure. Without it, you will see a warning every time you visit the site that indicates the site is not safe to use. 

# Request LetsEncrypt certificate

To configure TLS for our application, we are using the free Lets Encrypt certificate authority. We need to request a TLS certificate, convert it to a format tomcat can read, and then update our tomcat server configuration to use the certificate. 

In order for Lets Encrypt to issue a certificate, the server requesting the certificate **must own the domain it is trying to request a cert for.** This means if we are requesting a certificate for our sandbox domain, `sandbox.fsig-mrs.com`, we need to make sure our server IP is set up for that domain. 

In AWS, enter Route 53 into the navigation bar. On the Route53 management page, go to Hosted Zones and select fsig-mrs.com. You should see something similar to the below image:

If a record exists for sandbox(or whatever domain you are trying to configure), delete it before creating a new record. DO NOT remove the NS or SOA type records. Also take care not to delete the production A record. 

Create a new record with the below configuration. It should be an A type. The record name should be `sandbox` or whatever domain you are trying to set up. The remainder of the domain, [`fsig-mrs.com`](http://fsig-mrs.com) is appended automatically to the record. That means you are updating the production instance, the record name you enter will be blank. In the value field, enter the IP address for the EC2 instance you are configuring. This IP address can be found on the EC2 management page in AWS. 

![Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 11.44.36 AM.png](TLS%20Configuration%20157937b9044780b696deeb235ee70057/Screenshot_2024-12-09_at_11.44.36_AM.png)

Now that the EC2 instance is connected to the desired domain name, you can SSH to the instance and run the following commands in the server terminal. 

Install certbot and request the certificate:

```xml
sudo dnf -y install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
```

This will prompt you to fill out some information regarding the domain name and any contact information. Use the [**openmrs.fsig.cu@gmail.com](mailto:openmrs.fsig.cu@gmail.com)** email account. 

If things have been configured correctly up to this point, you should receive a response like this that tells you where the certificate and key have been saved:

```xml
Requesting a certificate for sandbox.fsig-mrs.com

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-01-12.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

# Certificate configuration

To finish setting up the certificate, we need to install the OpenMRS application onto the server. Run the below commands in the server terminal to do so:

```xml
sudo su
cd /opt/tomcat/webapps
mkdir openmrs
cd openmrs
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmrs/files/releases/OpenMRS_Reference_Application_2.13.0/openmrs.war
unzip openmrs.war
chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps/openmrs
chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/webapps/
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

Now we need to convert the certificate and key into JKS(java keystore) format. Copy and enter the below multi-line command. Note that if the domain you are setting up is not `sandbox.fsig-mrs.com`, you will need to update the path in the `-in` and `-inkey` lines to match where your certificate and key are stored. This location can be found in the LetsEncrypt response when you requested the certificate. 

This command will prompt you to enter a password for the encryption. Make note of the password used as you will need to pass it into the next command

```xml
openssl pkcs12 -export -out /opt/tomcat/webapps/fsig-mrs.com_fullchain_and_key.p12 \
    -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/fullchain.pem \
    -inkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/privkey.pem \
    -name tomcat
```

Copy and enter this entire multi-line command to import the updated keystore. Make sure to enter the actual password in the <PASSWORD> placeholder.

```xml
keytool -importkeystore \
    -deststorepass <PASSWORD> -destkeypass <PASSWORD> -destkeystore /opt/tomcat/webapps/fsig-mrs.com.jks \
    -srckeystore /opt/tomcat/webapps/fsig-mrs.com_fullchain_and_key.p12  -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass <PASSWORD> \
    -alias tomcat
```

Now we need to update our tomcat server configuration file to use the new certificate. Open the server.xml file:

```xml
sudo vi /opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml
```

Navigate to the section of the file that configures the Connectors. Remove the existing connector, and replace it with the following two connectors. Make sure to insert the actual password where you see the <PASSWORD> placeholder. 

```xml
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="443" />
<Connector port="443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
            maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
            keystoreFile="/opt/tomcat/webapps/fsig-mrs.com.jks"
            keystorePass="<PASSWORD>"
            clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
```

Save and exit the file. Restart tomcat:

```xml
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

To verify your changes, open a web browser and go to the domain you just configured, in this sandbox example it would be: [https://sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/openmrs](https://sandbox.fsig-mrs.com/openmrs) and verify that the page has the lock icon indicating it is secure. Note that a tomcat restart may take a few minutes to complete. 

# Configure automatic certificate renewal

LetsEncrypt certificates expire in 60 days, and they do not automatically renew due to the reformatting we do to allow our application to read the certificate. To avoid doing this manually, we have a scheduled job that runs on the first of every month to renew our certificate. In this folder you will see three files,  renewcert.sh, renewcert.timer and renewcert.service. These files respectively contain the script that renews and reformats the certificate, the timer that schedules this service, and the service definition that runs the script. 

To set up automatic renewal on a new server, make sure to update these files by inserting the password in any <PASSWORD> placeholders, then follow the below instructions. 

Create the [renewcert.sh](http://renewcert.sh) file, paste the script contents into the file and save it

```xml
sudo vi /usr/local/bin/renewcert.sh
```

update the file permissions and test the script:

```xml
sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/renewcert.sh
cd /usr/local/bin/
sudo ./renewcert.sh
```

Create the renewcert.timer file, paste the file contents and save it

```xml
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/renewcert.timer
```

Create the renewcert.service file, paste the file contents and save it

```xml
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/renewcert.service
```

Reload the daemon, enable and then start the timer

```xml

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable renewcert.timer
sudo systemctl start renewcert.timer
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors with the timer, run the below to diagnose the issue

```xml
systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/renewcert.*
```

To check the timer status and job logs, run

```xml
sudo systemctl status renewcert.timer
sudo journalctl -u renewcert.service
```
