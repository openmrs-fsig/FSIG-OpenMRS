# Common Issues

# Patient search not working

If you receive no results in the system when searching for patients, the search index may need to be rerun. Navigate to the legacy administration page and click on the Search Index link. Click the button that says Rebuild Search Index. This may take a few minutes to run, and should be run outside of clinic hours. 

# Expired TLS certificate

If the automatic renewal of our TLS certificate fails, the webpage will show an error indicating it is not a secure site. If this happens we need to fix the scheduled job that generates a new TLS certificate. The instructions for troubleshooting this scheduled job are in the [TLS Configuration page](TLS%20Configuration%20157937b9044780b696deeb235ee70057.md)

# Run out of server space

If there is not enough memory allocated to our server, the application will begin to experience slowness when loading and display other odd behavior. This can be resolved by redeploying the server with an upgraded instance type(t2.medium to t2.large for example) or by allocating more GiB of external memory. To figure out the best solution, take a look at the instance metrics on the AWS dashboard.
