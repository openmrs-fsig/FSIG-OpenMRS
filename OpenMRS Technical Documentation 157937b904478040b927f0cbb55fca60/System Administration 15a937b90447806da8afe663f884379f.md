# System Administration

OpenMRS has two views for system administration. You will need administrator permissions to view these pages. 

To access from the home page, click on System Administration. This will give you access to managing extensions and applications, accounts and global properties. 

Clicking Advanced Administrations from this page brings you to the legacy administration page. This page has different formatting and UI, but brings you a lot more options in terms of administering various parts of the application. From the advanced administration page, you can create new patient fields, new relationship types, and manage many of the modules that are included in the system.
